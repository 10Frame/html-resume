        <p>I find beekeeping to be very relaxing and emotionally therapeutic. It's a great way to
             appreciate and bond with nature all while getting a pretty sweet reward at the end of the season.
             This hobby isn't necessarily for the faint of heart as one will be covered in stinging insects on a regular basis,
             but with the right mindset and a good queen there is no need to fear. I don't even wear gloves when
              I'm in the hives!! I highly recomend beekeeping to anyone who is interested in helping the environment and improving their garden.
